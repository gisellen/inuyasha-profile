# Inuyasha Profile
An application focused on the visualization and description of the main characters of a popular anime in the late 90s, Inuyasha by Rumiko Takahashi, originally published by Shogakukan.

This is apart of the profile series where I create applications that showcases dynamic visuals and descriptions of characters from different media.  This project is inspired by the japanese web development aesthetics and video game website showcases.
